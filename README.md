# Data Saiyentist

I'm a highly motivated engineering student who'd like to become a Data scientist.
</br>
Later, I'd like to invest my time in green energy in order to be useful.
</br>
I'm currently a 2nd year student at [ENSIIE](https://www.ensiie.fr/) which is a French computer science engineering school.

My first attraction for artificial intelligence (AI) borned when I discovered the Turing test through the Kamski test (introduced in the video game [Detroit: Become Human](https://www.quanticdream.com/en/detroit-become-human)).
</br>
The Kamski test wonders whether machines are capable of empathy, more precisely whether an android is capable to kill its fellows. 
</br>
If the android doesn't murder its fellow, then it shows empathy and the test succeeds.
</br>
Likewise, the Turing test verifies whether machines have intelligent behavior equivalent to human beings.

In my opinion, in the next years, machines will pass the Turing test and our concerns about AI surpassing its creators will become reality. Indeed, machines have already surpassed us in some limited domaines. For instance, eweryone knows that the best human chess players in the world have been defeated by artificial intelligence.
</br>
However, nature made humans complex: that is our character trait.
</br>
Would machines be able to create a paint, a book or a music ? It's true that machines have also begun tackling some of this fields. 
</br>
Yet, they can't reproduce that something which
is typical of humans.

So, I think that combined with AI we can do great things and maybe we can achieve the impossible.
